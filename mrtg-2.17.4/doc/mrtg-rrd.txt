       mrtg-rrd - How to use RRDtool with MRTG

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       After using MRTG for some time you may find some limitations, mostly in
       the areas of performance and graphing flexibility. These are exactly
       the areas addressed by RRDtool. To learn more about RRDtool check out
       its website on

        http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool

RRRRDDTTOOOOLL IINNTTEEGGRRAATTIIOONN
       When using mrtg with RRDtool you are replacing _r_a_t_e_u_p with the RRDtool
       perl module _R_R_D_s_._p_m. To enable RRDtool support in mrtg you have to add
       the line

        LogFormat: rrdtool

       to your mrtg config file.

       MRTG needs access to both the RRDtool perl module RRRRDDss..ppmm and to the
       rrrrddttooooll executable.

       If these two items are not installed in locations where perl can find
       them on its own, then you can use the following two parameters to
       supply the appropriate directories.

       For the location of the rrrrddttooooll executable you put

        PathAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/bin/

       or

        PathAdd: c:\rrdtool\bin

       For the location of the perl module it would be:

        LibAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/lib/perl/

       or

        LibAdd: c:\rrdtool\bin\lib\perl

       When you have made this modification to the configuration file, several
       things will happen when you run mrtg again with the new config file:

       1.  mrtg will take all your old ".log" files and ccoonnvveerrtt them to ".rrd"
           format. (The ".log" files don't get touched in the process, so if
           things don't work out they are still there.)

       2.  mrtg will use rrrrddttooooll to update its databases. These will have a
           new format called _r_r_d which is totally different than the native
           _l_o_g format of the classic mrtg.

       3.  mrtg will nnoott create any webpages of graphs anymore.  It will only
           query the routers for traffic information and update its _r_r_d
           databases.

       The advantage of whole thing is that the mrtg will become mmuucchh faster.
       Expect the runtime to drop to 20% of the previous value. (I would like
       to get some feedback on this from folks with large installations.)

       Mind you, though, while the logging process of RRDtool is vveerryy fast,
       you are also gaining some time by neither creating graphs nor updating
       webpages.  The idea behind this is that it is more efficient to create
       graphs and webpages on demand by using a cgi script.

       At the moment there is no ooffffiicciiaall script to do this, but two
       contributers have created such scripts:

       One4All aka 14all.cgi
           This was the first program to take over the webpage creation and
           graphing task.  It has been developed by Rainer Bawidamann
           rainer.bawidamann@web.de. You can find a copy on Rainers website:
           http://my14all.sourceforge.net/ The program comes with its own
           documentation

       rroouutteerrss22..ccggii
           This is another CGI frontend for mrtg running with rrdtool. The
           main difference between this and 14all is that the web pages it
           creates are much more stylish than the ones from mrtg, plus they
           support User Defined summary graphs and different levels of
           Authentication and Authorisation. This has been written by Steve
           Shipway (steve@steveshipway.org). You obtain a copy, and find a
           forum and demonstration system at
           http://www.steveshipway.org/software/ The program comes with its
           own installation instructions and install script.

       mmrrttgg--rrrrdd
           The mrtg-rrd script is a CGI/FastCGI application by Jan "Yenya"
           Kasprzak for displaying MRTG graphs from data in the RRDtool
           format. It is an intended replacement for the 14all.cgi script. It
           can make your monitoring system faster because MRTG does not have
           to generate all the PNG files with graphs every 5 minutes or so.
           Instead of this the graphs are generated on-demand when the user
           wants to see them. http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/mrtg-rrd/

FFUUTTUURREE
       Just as a side note: MRTG-3 will be based entirely on rrdtool
       technology.  But don't wait for it ... get going nnooww!
